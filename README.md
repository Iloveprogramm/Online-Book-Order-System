## 2. Why Use XAMPP?

XAMPP is a server that allows us to run the code we have written on the server. In this project, we will be using the XAMPP server and MySQL. When you launch XAMPP, you'll see the following screen:

Ensure that both the **Apache Web Server** and **MySQL Database** are activated to complete the setup.


## 3. How to Create a Database using XAMPP?

Type `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in the browser. If you haven’t started the MySQL Database, this link won’t open; make sure MySQL is running first.

1. Create a database named: bookonlineorder

2. Next, inside this database, enter the SQL code. All my database creation codes are in the GitHub repository; everyone should also save their SQL code therein, making it easier to consolidate all the codes and databases later.

3. The third step is data insert, which is "insert into". The operation is the same as above, and the SQL code is also provided in the file.

## 4. How to Run PHP Code?
Ensure that the **Apache Web Server** is running. Type `localhost` into your browser. This will display the local directory, which corresponds to the files under the **htdocs** directory. Place your PHP files within the **htdocs** directory, and then access the respective file path in the browser to run the PHP code.

1. Locate your xampp folder:

2. Find the htdocs folder:

3. Place your code within the htdocs directory:

4. Search for "localhost" in the browser:
<img width="950" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Iloveprogramm/-Book-Online-Order-System/assets/96208001/29ab29b6-2c14-46f8-b054-a57804652dfb">

## Important Reminder

Please ensure that you retain the SQL statements for creating your database in the file. Since we aren’t sharing databases, this means you need to create the database for me as well as for yourself. Just by copying and pasting the SQL statements, you can effortlessly create databases for others.

PHP

PHP offers dynamic content that interacts smoothly with databases, making it an excellent choice for the backend.
